# Mod Test Subgame

A very basic subgame for minetest to test and develop a mod.

### Mapgen

The mapgen is really basic. No landscapes, no things. Only a flat, infinite ground, only one type of block (the default block is "default:cobble", you can change it (change the first line of the file ./mods/mapgen/init.lua)).

### Mods

The mods of this subgame are :
* `default` : The default mod (from the minimal subgame).
